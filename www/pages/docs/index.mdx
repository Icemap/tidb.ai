## Main Features

Conversational Search with Built-in Web Crawler: Our AI-powered conversational search comes with a built-in website crawler. It can effortlessly scrape sitemap URL lists, enabling seamless information retrieval.

This widget, typically placed at the bottom right corner of your site, facilitates instant responses to product-related queries.
