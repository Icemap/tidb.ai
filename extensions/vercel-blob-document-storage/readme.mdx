`VercelBlobDocumentStorage` supports storing raw document contents in
[Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob). It's useful when you want to deploy your RAG app on Vercel.

Make sure you configured your [Environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) properly.
