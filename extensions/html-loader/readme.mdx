HTML Loader parses raw HTML documents into text contents.

By default, it will extract all text content in `<body>` tag, it usually contains huge amount of unuseful information
for searching. It's recommended to configure CSS selectors `contentExtraction` to make sure the HTML loader will extract
proper content in your web page.
